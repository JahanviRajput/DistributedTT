# Demos

We choose some benchmarks to demonstrate the working of our methods DiPTS, NPTS and SSPTS.

## Description

The files in this folder run independently, the functions are defined for each function within the file. Running the file will return results for the function as described in the file name. Within `linear_regression.py` we model a simple regression problem as an optimization problem and find a solutions using the original PROTES algorithm.
